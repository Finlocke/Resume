             <li><b>Public Speaking</b>: During my time in the Army as well as working in the costumer service industry I have developed a greater than average ability to converse both to large crowds as well as an ability to communicate effectivly in 1 on 1 conversations.</li>
             <li><b>Critical thinking/Problem Solving</b>: Both my jobs listed require a great amount of both of these qualities to diagnose a human or machine you have to look at the whole as well as the parts and wittle the parts down to find the major issues affecting it from working correctly.</li>
             <li><b>Teamwork</b>:A major part of working in an evacuation team or leading a trauma team is your ability to work as a cohesive unit you have to be able to trust that the person next to you is trained well enough to get the job done or a persons life may be at risk and that pressure lends well to being part of a cohesive team.</li>
             <li><b>Leadership</b>: When I was working as the senior line medic of C Co. it was required of me to develop my leadership skills and show my guys how to do their jobs as well as lead them through major incidents and challenges.</li>
